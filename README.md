# VideoAnnotationTool

## What is it?
A tool which enables the user to import a video of their choice and start a project based on this video, in which the user can navigate through the frames of the chosen video, and add annotations as a form of metadata to the frames of the video.

The user can then export this metadata in the form of a JSON file, along with PNG images of the annotated frames. Since the tool is project-based, the user can import projects which have previously been exported using that project's JSON file.


## Information about code bundle

The application is built and packaged using Electron JS.

We are using a web framework (React JS) for the user interface and design of the app.
